# Icon Font for Engage
This repository holds resources for creating an icon font for use within Mapp Engage UI based on
[Unify Design Sytem](https://xd.adobe.com/view/530f9721-95c9-4d28-ae8d-c61588cafae6-065c/screen/fbeb8494-d13d-4796-848d-1d4fe16be769/).

## Usage
1. Install as dependency in your project: `npm install @mapp-ui/engage-iconfont`
1. Import the css: `@import "~@mapp-ui/engage-iconfont/dist/engage-icons.css";`  
   Note: `~` is angular-cli specific shortcut to the node_modules folder. If you are not using angular-cli in your
   project, you might need to construct the actual path manually.
1. Create elements with class `mui-icons` in your html for using an icon from the font. The icon can be generated by
   referencing its name in the tag content. This is made possible by a font feature called 'ligatures'. Example:  
   `<span class="mui-icons">profile</span>`

## Contribution guidelines
### Icon naming
New icons should be placed in `src/icons` or an additional sub-folder below `src/icons`. File name should be the plain
name of the icon, as it should be referenced later on in the markup. Don't use any unnecessary prefixes like 'icon.' or
'icon-'.

### Icon format
As the conversion libraries do have some limitations regarding certain svg features, icons should be uploaded in a
compatible format, which only uses path elements (see the already existing icons for reference).
